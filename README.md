# Google Data Analytics Course - Capstone Projects

Collection of scripts and charts from doing Google Data Analytics course capstone projects.
Proceed to each folder to read the full details of each case study.

## Case 1 - Cyclystic
### Synopsis

Cyclystic, a bike-share company in Chicago gave me, a junior data analyst, a task to find advantageous marketing strategies to attract casual riders to subscribe to the annual membership. Data acquired from all the available bicycles, which are all geotracked, is provided so that the trend between the casual riders and members can be identified. Only the past year's data would be used for the analysis.


## Case 3 - World suicide rate

### Synopsis

Every year more than half a million people take their own life, and many more who attempt to do so, causing tragedies that affect families, communities, and causing long lasting effects on those who are left behind.

Suicide does not only happen in certain countries, in fact it is a global phenomenon throughout the world. However, each country has different rate of suicide, some of which have huge gaps with other countries. Happiness is an obvious main factor for the desire to commit suicide. But, what exactly makes people happy. Is it the same across all types of humans? Hence the question is, is there an actual main cause for suicides in the first place? If so, what is it? Knowing this could be the answer to tackling this issue with correct method of prevention.

I will make an attempt to determine the causes by analysing data recording the world's past suicide rate as well as other probable factors which would increase the total number of suicides.


## Advanced course - Salifort Motors

### Synopsis

Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.        

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, I have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked me with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like me to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points I deem helpful.
